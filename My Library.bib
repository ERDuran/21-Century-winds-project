  abstract = {Abstract Planetary or Rossby waves are the predominant way in which the ocean adjusts on long (year to decade) timescales. The motion of long planetary waves is westward, at speeds $\geq$1 cm s-1. Until recently, very few experimental investigations of such waves were possible because of scarce data. The advent of satellite altimetry has changed the situation considerably. Curiously, the speeds of planetary waves observed by TOPEX/Poseidon are mainly faster than those given by standard linear theory. This paper examines why this should be. It is argued that the major changes to the unperturbed wave speed will be caused by the presence of baroclinic east\textendash{}west mean flows, which modify the potential vorticity gradient. Long linear perturbations to such flow satisfy a simple eigenvalue problem (related directly to standard quasigeostrophic theory). Solutions are mostly real, though a few are complex. In simple situations approximate solutions can be obtained analytically. Using archive data, the global problem is treated. Phase speeds similar to those observed are found in most areas, although in the Southern Hemisphere an underestimate of speed by the theory remains. Thus, the presence of baroclinic mean flow is sufficient to account for the majority of the observed speeds. It is shown that phase speed changes are produced mainly by (vertical) mode-2 east\textendash{}west velocities, with mode-1 having little or no effect. Inclusion of the mean barotropic flow from a global eddy-admitting model makes only a small modification to the fit with observations; whether the fit is improved is equivocal.},

  volume = {120},
  abstract = {Abstract The seasonal circulation around the southwestern boundary of Australia is documented using sea level anomalies from satellite altimetry. Results extrapolated to the coast agree closely with tide gauge observations indicating that seasonal altimeter fields are realistic. Monthly sea level maps identify an annual propagating wave along a waveguide extending along the shelf edge, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to southern Tasmania. The annual sea level pulse does not originate from the Pacific Ocean, as annual Pacific sea level variations are completely out of phase with signals south of the Indonesian archipelago. The presence of a phase discontinuity is demonstrated in annual sea level, temperature, and salinity observations. The origin of the Leeuwin Current seasonality is in the Gulf of Carpentaria where monsoonal winds drive a massive buildup of sea level from November to December. During December\textendash{}February, a sea level ``pulse'' emerges from the region, and rapidly propagates poleward along the western and southern Australian boundary. In the broad shelf region centered at 19$^\circ$S, an independent process forms a high sea level feature when a positive heat flux anomaly induces an annual increase in sea surface temperature which is rapidly mixed through the water column by the strong regional tides. In March, the winds relax and switch to a downwelling favorable alongshore component. In this period, the sea level pulse is essentially in a quasi-static equilibrium with the annual propagating wind systems. The change in cross-shelf sea level gradient along the 8000 km path length at the western and southern boundaries, drives the seasonal changes in the Leeuwin Current flow.},

  abstract = {Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been observed around the world and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency under anthropogenic climate change. A variety of impacts have been associated with these anomalous events, including shifts in species ranges, local extinctions and economic impacts on seafood industries through declines in important fishery species and impacts on aquaculture. Extreme temperatures are increasingly seen as important influences on biological systems, yet a consistent definition of MHWs does not exist. A clear definition will facilitate retrospective comparisons between MHWs, enabling the synthesis and a mechanistic understanding of the role of MHWs in marine ecosystems. Building on research into atmospheric heatwaves, we propose both a general and specific definition for MHWs, based on a hierarchy of metrics that allow for different data sets to be used in identifying MHWs. We generally define a MHW as a prolonged discrete anomalously warm water event that can be described by its duration, intensity, rate of evolution, and spatial extent. Specifically, we consider an anomalously warm event to be a MHW if it lasts for five or more days, with temperatures warmer than the 90th percentile based on a 30-year historical baseline period. This structure provides flexibility with regard to the description of MHWs and transparency in communicating MHWs to a general audience. The use of these metrics is illustrated for three 21st century MHWs; the northern Mediterranean event in 2003, the Western Australia `Ningaloo Ni\~no' in 2011, and the northwest Atlantic event in 2012. We recommend a specific quantitative definition for MHWs to facilitate global comparisons and to advance our understanding of these phenomena.},

  doi = {10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00259.1},
  abstract = {AbstractOcean climate extremes have received little treatment in the literature, aside from coastal sea level and temperatures affecting coral bleaching. Further, it is notable that extremes (e.g., temperature and precipitation) are typically not well represented in global climate models. Here, the authors improve dynamically downscaled ocean climate model estimates of sea surface temperature (SST) extremes in the Tasman Sea off southeastern Australia using satellite remotely sensed observed extreme SSTs and the simulated marine climate of the 1990s. This is achieved using a Bayesian hierarchical model in which the parameters of an extreme value distribution are modeled by linear regression onto the key marine climate variables (e.g., mean SST, SST variance, etc.). The authors then apply this fitted model, essentially a form of bias correction, to the marine climate projections for the 2060s under an A1B emissions scenario. They show that the extreme SSTs are projected to increase in the Tasman Sea in a nonuniform way. The 50-yr return period extreme SSTs are projected to increase by up to 2$^\circ$C over the entire domain and by up to 4$^\circ$C in a hotspot located in the central western portion of the Tasman Sea, centered at a latitude \textasciitilde{}500 km farther south than the projected change in mean SST. The authors show that there is a greater than 50\% chance that annual maximum SSTs will increase by at least 2$^\circ$C in this hotspot and that this change is significantly different than that which might be expected because of random chance in an unchanged climate.},

Recent prominent marine heatwaves have attracted considerable scientific and public interest. Despite this, a comprehensive assessment of how these ocean temperature extremes have been changing globally is missing. Using a range of ocean temperature data including global records of daily satellite observations, daily in situ measurements and gridded monthly in situ-based data sets, we identify significant increases in marine heatwaves over the past century. We find that from 1925 to 2016, global average marine heatwave frequency and duration increased by 34\% and 17\%, respectively, resulting in a 54\% increase in annual marine heatwave days globally. Importantly, these trends can largely be explained by increases in mean ocean temperatures, suggesting that we can expect further increases in marine heatwave days under continued global warming.},

Though many systems have been lost and destroyed, for systems that remain physically intact, there is debate as to whether changing temperatures will result in shifts or collapses. Wernburg et al. show that extreme warming of a temperate kelp forest off Australia resulted not only in its collapse, but also in a shift in community composition that brought about an increase in herbivorous tropical fishes that prevent the reestablishment of kelp. Thus, many systems may not be resilient to the rapid climate change that we face.Science, this issue p. 169Ecosystem reconfigurations arising from climate-driven changes in species distributions are expected to have profound ecological, social, and economic implications. Here we reveal a rapid climate-driven regime shift of Australian temperate reef communities, which lost their defining kelp forests and became dominated by persistent seaweed turfs. After decades of ocean warming, extreme marine heat waves forced a 100-kilometer range contraction of extensive kelp forests and saw temperate species replaced by seaweeds, invertebrates, corals, and fishes characteristic of subtropical and tropical waters. This community-wide tropicalization fundamentally altered key ecological processes, suppressing the recovery of kelp forests.},

  abstract = {In 2015/16, a marine heatwave associated with a record El Ni\~no led to the third global mass bleaching event documented to date. This event impacted coral reefs around the world, including in Western Australia (WA), although WA reefs had largely escaped bleaching during previous strong El Ni\~no years. Coral health surveys were conducted during the austral summer of 2016 in four bioregions along the WA coast (~17 degrees of latitude), ranging from tropical to temperate locations. Here we report the first El Ni\~no-related regional-scale mass bleaching event in WA. The heatwave primarily affected the macrotidal Kimberley region in northwest WA (~16$^\circ$S), where 4.5-9.3 degree heating weeks (DHW) resulted in 56.6-80.6\% bleaching, demonstrating that even heat-tolerant corals from naturally extreme, thermally variable reef environments are threatened by heatwaves. Some heat stress (2.4 DHW) and bleaching ($<$30\%) also occurred at Rottnest Island (32$^\circ$01'S), whereas coral communities at Ningaloo Reef (23$^\circ$9'S) and Bremer Bay (34$^\circ$25'S) were not impacted. The only other major mass bleaching in WA occurred during a strong La Ni\~na event in 2010/11 and primarily affected reefs along the central-to-southern coast. This suggests that WA reefs are now at risk of severe bleaching during both El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na years.},

  title = {Management Adaptation of Invertebrate Fisheries to an Extreme Marine Heat Wave Event at a Global Warming Hot Spot},
  volume = {6},
  doi = {10.1002/ece3.2137},
  abstract = {Abstract An extreme marine heat wave which affected 2000 km of the midwest coast of Australia occurred in the 2010/11 austral summer, with sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies of 2\textendash{}5$^\circ$C above normal climatology. The heat wave was influenced by a strong Leeuwin Current during an extreme La Ni\~na event at a global warming hot spot in the Indian Ocean. This event had a significant effect on the marine ecosystem with changes to seagrass/algae and coral habitats, as well as fish kills and southern extension of the range of some tropical species. The effect has been exacerbated by above-average SST in the following two summers, 2011/12 and 2012/13. This study examined the major impact the event had on invertebrate fisheries and the management adaption applied. A 99\% mortality of Roei abalone (Haliotis roei) and major reductions in recruitment of scallops (Amusium balloti), king (Penaeus latisulcatus) and tiger (P. esculentus) prawns, and blue swimmer crabs were detected with management adapting with effort reductions or spatial/temporal closures to protect the spawning stock and restocking being evaluated. This study illustrates that fisheries management under extreme temperature events requires an early identification of temperature hot spots, early detection of abundance changes (preferably using pre-recruit surveys), and flexible harvest strategies which allow a quick response to minimize the effect of heavy fishing on poor recruitment to enable protection of the spawning stock. This has required researchers, managers, and industry to adapt to fish stocks affected by an extreme environmental event that may become more frequent due to climate change.},

  doi = {10.1175/JCLI3843.1},
  abstract = {Abstract The coupled ocean\textendash{}atmosphere\textendash{}ice response to variations in the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is examined in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Coupled Climate Model (version 2). The model shows considerable skill in capturing the predominantly zonally symmetric SAM while regional deviations between model and observation SAM winds go a long way in explaining the generally small differences between simulated and observed SAM responses in the ocean and sea ice systems. Vacillations in the position and strength of the circumpolar winds and the ensuing variations in advection of heat and moisture result in a dynamic and thermodynamic forcing of the ocean and sea ice. Both meridional and zonal components of ocean circulation are modified through Ekman transport, which in turn leads to anomalous surface convergences and divergences that strongly affect the meridional overturning circulation and potentially the pathways of intermediate water ventilation. A heat budget analysis demonstrates a conspiring of oceanic meridional heat advection, surface heat fluxes, and changes in mixed layer depth, which acts in phase to imprint a strong circumpolar SAM signature onto sea surface temperatures (SSTs), while other oceanic processes, including vertical advection, are shown to play only a minor role in contrast to previous suggestions. Lagged correlations show that although the SAM is mainly controlled by internal atmospheric mechanisms, the thermal inertia of the ocean reimprints the SAM signature back onto surface air temperatures (SATs) on time scales longer than the initial atmospheric signal. Sea ice variability is well explained by a combination of atmospheric and oceanic dynamic and thermodynamic forcing, and by an albedo feedback mechanism that allows ice extent anomalies to persist for many months. Nonzonally symmetric components of the SAM winds, particularly in the region surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula, have important effects for other climate variables.},

Here we analyse the outputs of a series of global warming experiments from the CSIRO Mark 3 climate model. We show that although for the zonal wind stress change the maximum is located at approximately 60$^\circ$S, in terms of the change in surface wind stress curl, the maximum is situated at approximately 48$^\circ$S. This change in the wind stress curl causes a spin-up of the entire southern midlatitude ocean circulation including a southward strengthening of the subtropical gyres, particularly the East Australia Current (EAC). The intensified EAC generates a warming rate in the Tasman Sea that is the greatest in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) with significant implications for sea level rise. The pan-Southern Ocean scale suggests a broad impact on the marine ecosystem of the entire southern midlatitude ocean.},

  abstract = {Abstract Daily variations in Australian rainfall and surface temperature associated with the Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) are documented using observations for the period 1979\textendash{}2005. The high index polarity of the SAM is characterized by a poleward contraction of the midlatitude westerlies. During winter, the high index polarity of the SAM is associated with decreased daily rainfall over southeast and southwest Australia, but during summer it is associated with increased daily rainfall on the southern east coast of Australia and decreased rainfall in western Tasmania. Variations in the SAM explain up to $\sim$15\% of the weekly rainfall variance in these regions, which is comparable to the variance accounted for by the El Ni\~no\textendash{}Southern Oscillation, especially during winter. The most widespread temperature anomalies associated with the SAM occur during the spring and summer seasons, when the high index polarity of the SAM is associated with anomalously low maximum temperature over most of central/eastern subtropical Australia. The regions of decreased maximum temperature are also associated with increased rainfall. Implications for recent trends in Australian rainfall and temperature are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this study, we explore the relationships between seasonal Australian rainfall and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). We produce two seasonal indices of the SAM: the Antarctic Oscillation Index (AOI), and an Australian regional version (AOIR) using ERA-40 mean sea-level pressure (MSLP) reanalysis data. The seasonal rainfall data are based on gridded monthly rainfall provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. For the period 1958\textendash{}2002 a significant inverse relationship is found between the SAM and rainfall in southern Australia, while a significant in-phase relationship is found between the SAM and rainfall in northern Australia. Furthermore, widespread significant inverse relationships in southern Australia are only observed in winter, and only with the AOIR. The AOIR accounts for more of the winter rainfall variability in southwest Western Australia, southern South Australia, western and southern Victoria, and western Tasmania than the Southern Oscillation Index. Overall, our results suggest that changes in the SAM may be partly responsible for the current decline in winter rainfall in southern South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania, but not the long-term decline in southwest Western Australian winter rainfall.

  doi = {10.1175/2009JCLI2640.1},
  abstract = {Abstract The seasonality of the southern annular mode (SAM) and the resulting impacts on the climate variability of New Zealand (NZ) are investigated. As with previous studies, during summer the SAM is found to be largely zonally symmetric, whereas during winter it exhibits increased zonal wavenumber 2\textendash{}3 variability. This is consistent with seasonal variations in the mean state, and the authors argue that the seasonal cycle of near-surface temperature over the Australian continent plays an important role, making the eddy-driven jet, and hence the SAM, more zonally symmetric during summer than winter. During winter, the SAM exhibits little variability over the South Pacific and southeast of Australia. Dynamical reasons for this behavior are discussed. For the NZ region this seasonality implies that fluctuations in the SAM are associated with a zonal wind speed anomaly during summer but a more meridional wind speed anomaly during winter. This behavior is well captured by temperature and rainfall station data, which serves to corroborate the seasonal changes seen in the large-scale analysis. Moreover, the mode of climate variability that corresponds to a fluctuation of the zonal wind speed is well correlated with the SAM during the summer only and exhibits less variance during the winter. This is consistent with the notion that the seasonality of the SAM significantly impacts modes of climate variability in the region.},

  volume = {25},
  doi = {10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00474.1},
  abstract = {AbstractThe Southern Hemisphere annular mode (SAM) is the dominant mode of climate variability in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. Representing variations in pressure and the corresponding changes to the circumpolar zonal flow, it is typically thought of as an ``annular'' or ringlike structure. However, on seasonal time scales the zonal symmetry observed in the SAM in monthly or annual mean data is much less marked. This study further examines the seasonal changes in the SAM structure and explores temperature signals across the Southern Hemisphere that are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure.The SAM asymmetries are most marked in the Pacific sector and in austral winter and spring, related to changes in the jet entrance and exit regions poleward of 30$^\circ$S. Depending on the season, the asymmetric SAM structure explains over 25\% of the variance in the overall SAM structure and has strong connections with ENSO or zonal wavenumber 3. In austral summer and autumn the SAM has been becoming more zonally symmetric, especially after 1980, perhaps tied to changes in anthropogenic forcing. Across the Pacific sector, including the Antarctic Peninsula, temperature variations are strongly tied to the asymmetric SAM structure, while temperatures across East Antarctica are more strongly tied to the zonally symmetric SAM structure.The results suggest that studies examining the climate impacts of the SAM across the Southern Hemisphere need to consider the seasonal variations in the SAM structure as well as varying impacts between its positive and negative polarity to adequately describe the underlying relationships.},

It was originally designed to be compatible with the Parallel Ocean Program (POP), an ocean circulation model developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for use on massively parallel computers. CICE has several interacting components: a vertical thermodynamic model that computes local growth rates of snow and ice due to vertical conductive, radiative and turbulent fluxes, along with snowfall; an elastic-viscous-plastic model of ice dynamics, which predicts the velocity field of the ice pack based on a model of the material strength of the ice; an incremental remapping transport model that describes horizontal advection of the areal concentration, ice and snow volume and other state variables; and a ridging parameterization that transfers ice among thickness categories based on energetic balances and rates of strain. It also includes a biogeochemical model that describes evolution of the ice ecosystem. The CICE sea ice model is used for climate research as one component of complex global earth system models that include atmosphere, land, ocean and biogeochemistry components. It is also used for operational sea ice forecasting in the polar regions and in numerical weather prediction models.},

Four reanalysis products, namely from 1) the interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim), 2) version 2 of the Common Reference Ocean\textendash{}Ice Experiments (CORE2), 3) the 25-Year Japanese Reanalysis Project (JRA-25), and 4) NCEP\textendash{}NCAR, are evaluated against satellite-derived observations for eight different fields (zonal and meridional winds, precipitation, specific humidity, continental discharge, surface air temperature, and downwelling longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes). No single product is found to agree better in all fields with satellite-derived observations. Reanalysis products are mostly comparable to each other because of their similar physical assumptions and assimilation of common observations. Adjusted atmospheric fields from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) optimizations are also in agreement with other reanalysis products. Time-mean and time-variable errors are estimated separately and mapped globally in space, based on 14-day average fields to focus on monthly to interannual periods. Time-variable errors are larger in comparison to the signal than time-mean errors for most fields, thus justifying the need to separate them for studying uncertainties as well as formulating optimization procedures. Precipitation and wind stress fields show significant time-mean and time-variable errors whereas downwelling radiation, air temperature, and humidity fields show small time-mean errors but large time-variable errors, particularly in the tropics. Uncertainties based on evaluating multiple products presented here are considerably larger than uncertainties based on single product pairs.},

  abstract = {The ocean circulation in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) is dominated by the surface-intensified Leeuwin Current (LC) over the outer continental shelf, and the Flinders Current farther offshore. In the GAB, the LC flows eastwards and varies seasonally, with strongest currents of up to 0.8 m/s (at 130.5$^\circ$E), bringing warm and salty waters as far east as western Tasmania. The Flinders Current flows westwards, as an undercurrent at depths of around 500 m over the continental slope and at the surface offshore of the LC. Off the shelf, the GAB is rich in mesoscale eddies, with surface-intensified currents of up to 0.4 m/s that are coherent over the full water depth (getting weaker with depth). Within deep-water eddies, isotherms are displaced vertically by up to 200 m. Eddies in the eastern GAB are most energetic in austral winter and spring - coincident with the seasonal weakening of the LC. The eastern-most ``penetration'' of GAB eddies occurs in austral winter - when the LC starts to weaken. We hypothesise that the horizontal shear associated with the LC generates eddies in the eastern GAB. The volume transport of the LC at the head of the GAB is typically between 1 and 7 Sv, with a clear seasonal cycle, and the interannual variability of LC transport is up to 2 Sv.},
